# Handwritten Digit Recognition with MNIST Dataset

## Overview

This project is a handwritten digit recognition system implemented using deep learning techniques. It is trained on the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark for image classification tasks. The goal of this project is to accurately classify and recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from scanned or digital images.

## Demo

Include a link to a live demo or a video demonstration of your project, if applicable.

## Features

- Recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) with high accuracy.
- Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- Trained on the MNIST dataset.
- Provides a sample script for testing the model on custom images.

## Requirements

Specify the software and libraries required to run the project. For example:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can also provide instructions on how to install these dependencies in the "Installation" section.

## Installation

Describe how to set up the project, including how to install the required dependencies. Provide step-by-step instructions, if possible.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Explain how to use your project. This could include running the model on custom images, using pre-trained weights, or integrating the recognition system into other applications.

For example, you might include code snippets like this:

python
# Load a pre-trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('pretrained_model.h5')

# Load an image for recognition
image = load_image('image.png')

# Make a prediction
digit = predict_digit(model, image)

print(f"Predicted digit: {digit}")

# Load a pre-trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('pretrained_model.h5')

# Load an image for recognition
image = load_image('image.png')

# Make a prediction
digit = predict_digit(model, image)

print(f"Predicted digit: {digit}")
Training
If your project involves training a model, provide instructions on how to do so. Include details like dataset preparation, hyperparameter tuning, and training scripts.

bash
python train.py

python train.py
Model Evaluation
Explain how to evaluate the performance of the model, including accuracy metrics and test data.

bash
python evaluate_model.py

python evaluate_model.py
Contributing
If you're open to contributions from others, specify how others can contribute to the project. You might include guidelines for pull requests, code reviews, and issue reporting.
